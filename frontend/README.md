- **Mentions Feed/Triage View**: Infinite scrolling feed with AI analysis details
- **Human-in-the-Loop Response Queue**: Approval/rejection interface for AI-generated responses
- **System Health Monitoring**: Live agent status, performance metrics, alerts

### 3.2 User Authentication System (Ready for Integration) ‚úÖ
- JWT authentication structure prepared in API service
- Protected route components ready
- User session management with localStorage
- Automatic token refresh and logout handling

### 3.3 Feedback Loop Mechanisms ‚úÖ
- HITL approval/rejection with detailed feedback forms
- AI learning integration through response feedback
- Crisis escalation workflows
- Performance analytics and system improvement tracking

### 3.4 System Hardening (Ready for Production) ‚úÖ
- Error boundary components with graceful fallbacks
- API retry logic and connection resilience  
- Real-time data refresh with configurable intervals
- Comprehensive monitoring and alerting UI

## üöÄ Quick Start Instructions

### Backend Setup (if not already running)
```bash
cd backend
pip install -r requirements.txt
python main.py
```

### Frontend Setup
```bash
cd frontend
npm install
npm start
```

The dashboard will be available at `http://localhost:3000` and will connect to the FastAPI backend at `http://localhost:8000`.

- **Keyword Performance**: Trending topics and their sentiment impact
- **Platform Analytics**: Distribution across social media platforms
- **Crisis Detection**: Real-time crisis monitoring with confidence levels
- **24-hour Activity Patterns**: Heatmaps of mention activity

### 5. **System Health** (`/system-health`)
- **Infrastructure Monitoring**: Database, Redis, memory, CPU usage
- **AI Agent Status**: Individual agent health and performance metrics
- **System Alerts**: Critical system issues and warnings
- **Performance Metrics**: API response times, success rates, queue lengths

## üèóÔ∏è Architecture Integration

### API Integration Points
- **Monitoring API**: `/monitoring/metrics`, `/monitoring/health`, `/monitoring/alerts`
- **Mentions API**: `/mentions/`, `/mentions/{id}` with search and pagination
- **Analytics API**: `/analytics/sentiment-trends`, `/analytics/crisis-detection`
- **HITL API**: `/responses/queue`, `/responses/{id}/approve`, `/responses/{id}/reject`
- **Alerts API**: `/alerts/` with real-time crisis detection

### Real-time Features
- **Auto-refresh**: Metrics every 30s, health every 15s, alerts every 10s
- **Live Updates**: React Query with background refetching
- **Toast Notifications**: Success/error feedback for all actions
- **Loading States**: Graceful loading indicators throughout

### Responsive Design
- **Material-UI Dark Theme**: Professional, modern interface optimized for 24/7 monitoring
- **Mobile-responsive**: Works on tablets and mobile devices for on-the-go management
- **Accessibility**: WCAG compliant components with proper contrast and navigation

## üîó Integration with Autonomous Backend

The dashboard seamlessly integrates with your existing autonomous backend:

1. **Autonomous Operation Visibility**: See real-time AI agent actions and decisions
2. **Human Oversight Controls**: Intervene only when AI confidence is below thresholds
3. **Crisis Management**: Immediate alerts and escalation workflows
4. **Performance Optimization**: Feedback loops to continuously improve AI performance

## üìä Production Readiness

### Error Handling
- **API Connection Resilience**: Automatic retry with exponential backoff
- **Graceful Degradation**: Dashboard remains functional even with partial API failures
- **User-friendly Error Messages**: Clear feedback for connection or data issues

### Security
