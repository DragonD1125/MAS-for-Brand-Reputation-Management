        "sentiment": "negative",
        "platform": "twitter"
    },
    brand_context={"brand_name": "TechCorp", "industry": "technology"}
)

# Automatic quality assessment and personalization
quality_score = response["quality_assessment"]["quality_score"]  # 0.0-1.0
personalized = response["personalization_applied"]  # True/False
```
